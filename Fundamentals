%SECTION 2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Task 1
Create a row vector named x that starts at 5, ends at 15, and whose elements are separated by 1.
x = 5:1:15


Task 2
Create a variable named y that contains the row vector shown below.
 3  5  7  9  11 
y = 3:2:11


Task 3
Create a row vector named z that starts at 5, ends at 1, and whose elements are spaced by -1
z = 5:-1:1

Task 4
Create a row vector named A that starts at 0, ends at 12 and whose elements are spaced by 2.5
A = 0:2.5:12

Task 5
Create a row vector named B that starts at 0, ends at 1 and contains 90 evenly-spaced elements.
B = linspace(0,1,90)

%For linspace = (start,end,# of instances)

Task 6
Create a row vector named C that starts at 3*pi, ends at -pi and contains 20 evenly-spaced elements.
C = linspace(3*pi,-pi,20)

Further Practice
Try creating a vector using linspace that contains just 1 element and that starts from 0 and ends at 10.
Alternatively, try using the colon operator to create a vector that starts at 0, ends at 10, and has a spacing of 15.

FP1 = linspace(0,10,1)
FP2 = 0:11/15:10

%Array Creation Functions
%Instructions are in the task pane to the left. Complete and submit each task one at a time.

TASK 1
Create an array named x that has 3 rows and 4 columns and where every element is the number 1.
x = ones(3,4)


TASK 2
Create an array named x that has 3 rows and 4 columns and where every element is the number 5.
x = ones(3,4)*5

TASK 3
Create a 100-by-1 vector of uniformly distributed random numbers with the name xU.
xU = rand(100,1)

TASK 4
Create a 100-by-1 vector of normally distributed random numbers with the name xN.
xN = randn(100,1)


TASK 5
Create a 100-by-1 vector of uniformly distributed random integers with a maximum value of 10. Name the vector xI.
xI = randi(10,100,1)


TASK 6
Use randi to create a 100-by-1 vector of uniformly distributed random integers between 11 and 20. Name the vector xI2
xI2 = randi([11 20],100,1)

TASK 7 
Use rand to create a 100-by-1 vector of uniformly distributed random numbers between -1 and 1. Name the vector xU2
xU2 = -1 + (1-(-1))*rand(100,1)

TASK 8
Use randn to create a 100-by-1 vector of normally distributed random numbers with mean 100 and standard deviation 5. Name the vector xN2.
xN2 = 100 + 5*randn(100,1)

Further Practice
a = -12;
b = -2;
x = a + (b-a)*rand(1,1000);
