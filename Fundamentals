%Convert prices
%Convert the prices from USD/gallon to USD/liter using the conversion factor saved in the variable gal2lit.
gal2lit = 0.2642;
Australia = gal2lit*Australia;
Germany = gal2lit*Germany;
Mexico = gal2lit*Mexico;
Canada = gal2lit*Canada;

Task 1
Create a row vector named x that starts at 5, ends at 15, and whose elements are separated by 1.
x = 5:1:15


Task 2
Create a variable named y that contains the row vector shown below.
 3  5  7  9  11 
y = 3:2:11


Task 3
Create a row vector named z that starts at 5, ends at 1, and whose elements are spaced by -1
z = 5:-1:1

Task 4
Create a row vector named A that starts at 0, ends at 12 and whose elements are spaced by 2.5
A = 0:2.5:12

Task 5
Create a row vector named B that starts at 0, ends at 1 and contains 90 evenly-spaced elements.
B = linspace(0,1,90)

%For linspace = (start,end,# of instances)

Task 6
Create a row vector named C that starts at 3*pi, ends at -pi and contains 20 evenly-spaced elements.
C = linspace(3*pi,-pi,20)

Further Practice
Try creating a vector using linspace that contains just 1 element and that starts from 0 and ends at 10.
Alternatively, try using the colon operator to create a vector that starts at 0, ends at 10, and has a spacing of 15.

FP1 = linspace(0,10,1)
FP2 = 0:11/15:10
